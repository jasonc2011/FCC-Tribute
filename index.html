                    <p class="centered-text">Takashi Amano, center, overlooks the design and construction of his final masterpiece the 40 meter long, 160
                    thousand litre Nature Aquarium "Forests Underwater" at the Lisbon Aquarium.</p>

            <div id="tribute-info">
                <p class="centered-text">Considered the Father of Modern Aquarium Design, Amano employed Japanese gardening concepts such as <span class="italic-text">Wabi-sabi</span> and
                Zen rock arrangement. His tank compositions sought to mimic nature in their appearance. Amano also pioneered the
                extensive use of <span class="italic-text">Glossostigma elatinoides</span> and <span class="italic-text">Riccia fluitans</span> as plant material, and used shrimp as a means of
                controlling the growth of algae.</p>
            
                <p class="centered-text"> in Niigata, Japan in 1954, Amano first was known for his beautiful work photographing untouched tropical
                rainforests in the Amazon, Borneo, and West Africa. He used what he learned observing these environments to develop
                his ground breaking Nature Aquarium Style of aquascaping.</p>
            
                <p class="centered-text">He founded Aqua Design Amano Co., Ltd. in 1982, providing aquatic plant growing equipment. His photo books of what
                he called the "Nature Aquarium", <span class="italic-text">no Naka no Daishizen</span>, published in 1992, followed by <span class="italic-text">eno kaiki</span>,
                were translated into 7 languages.</p>
            
                <p class="centered-text quote">"What is the essence of a beautiful landscape? The compositional beauty produced by flora and other things may be
                part of it, but isn't it ultimately a perfectly functioning ecosystem? It is, in fact, a balance. The world of
                aquarium is no exception.....'what type of environment would I prefer if I were a fish' was always at the base when
                the layouts were created." - Takashi Amano</p>
